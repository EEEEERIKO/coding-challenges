# Technical Challenge – Node.js & Vanilla Frontend

This repository contains my progress solving a technical challenge designed to test **Full Stack Developer** skills, with a strong focus on backend (Node.js) and vanilla frontend.

---

## 📌 Challenge Overview
The challenge is structured into **7 exercises**, each with a timebox of 2 hours.  
The main goals are to demonstrate knowledge of **asynchrony, callbacks vs promises vs async/await, REST API creation, debugging, best practices, and refactoring**.

---

## 📝 Exercises

1. **Fix a function** – Correct the implementation of a buggy function.  
2. **Convert callbacks to promises** – Refactor a function so it works with promises instead of callbacks.  
3. **Code explanation & error detection** – Explain what a given function does, identify mistakes, and improve readability.  
4. **Improve synchronous calls** – Refactor code that uses synchronous calls to a cleaner and more efficient version.  
5. **Implement a delay function** – Write a custom `delay` function to handle asynchronous behavior.  
6. **Create a custom dotenv** – Build a simplified version of dotenv that detects and loads environment variables from a `.env` file.  
7. **Build a REST API with Express** – Create a small API using Express.js following REST principles.

## 🚀 Notes
This technical test is not from a real company.  
I am using it as a **learning exercise** to strengthen my backend and fullstack skills.
